# 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment is a form of unwelcome and offensive behavior of a sexual nature that creates a hostile or intimidating environment. It is essential to understand that sexual harassment is not caused by the victim's behavior but rather by the inappropriate actions of the harasser. Sexual harassment can occur in various settings, including workplaces, educational institutions, public spaces, and online platforms. Common behaviors that cause sexual harassment include:

## Unwanted sexual advances:
This includes making unwelcome sexual invitations, requests for sexual favors, or explicit comments about a person's appearance or body.

## Sexual comments or jokes: 
Making sexually suggestive remarks, jokes, or innuendos that are offensive or inappropriate.

## Unwanted physical contact: 
Any unwelcome touching, such as groping, hugging without consent, or other forms of physical contact of a sexual nature.

## Sexual intimidation or threats: 
Using sexually explicit threats or intimidation to coerce someone into engaging in sexual acts or to create a hostile environment.

## Displaying explicit materials: 
Showing sexually explicit images, videos, or materials to others without their consent.

## Sexually offensive gestures or facial expressions: 
Making lewd gestures or facial expressions of a sexual nature that make others uncomfortable.

## Sexual comments about appearance or clothing: 
Making inappropriate or sexually suggestive comments about a person's attire or physical appearance.

## Unwanted communication or advances online: 
Sending unsolicited sexually explicit messages, images, or videos through digital platforms.

## Invasion of personal space: 
Invading someone's personal space in a way that feels uncomfortable or threatening.

## Repeated unwanted attention: 
Persistently and inappropriately pursuing someone despite their lack of interest or consent.

It is important to note that sexual harassment is not limited to a specific gender and can happen to anyone. It is a violation of an individual's dignity and rights, and it is crucial to promote a culture of respect, equality, and consent to prevent and address such behavior. If you experience or witness sexual harassment, it is essential to report it to the appropriate authorities or your organization's designated channels for handling such issues.

# 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of sexual harassment, it is important to take appropriate action. Here are some steps you can consider taking:

## Assess your safety: 
If you feel physically threatened or unsafe, remove yourself from the situation immediately. Your safety and well-being are the top priorities.

## Document the incidents: 
Keep a record of dates, times, locations, and descriptions of the incidents. Include any witnesses, if applicable. This documentation can be helpful if you decide to report the harassment later.

## Seek support: 
Talk to someone you trust about what you have experienced or witnessed. This could be a friend, family member, colleague, or supervisor. They can provide emotional support and help you navigate the situation.

## Know your rights: 
Familiarize yourself with the policies and procedures related to sexual harassment in your workplace, educational institution, or community. Understand the options available to you for reporting and resolving such incidents.

## Report the harassment: 
If you feel comfortable and safe doing so, report the incidents to the appropriate authority or person designated to handle sexual harassment complaints. This could be your supervisor, human resources department, school administration, or local authorities, depending on the context.

## Preserve evidence: 
If there is any physical evidence, such as offensive messages, emails, or other documentation, make sure to preserve it. This evidence can support your case during investigations.

## Seek professional advice: 
If you are unsure about how to proceed or need legal advice, consider consulting an attorney or contacting a local organization that specializes in supporting survivors of sexual harassment. They can provide guidance and help you understand your options.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your safety and well-being throughout the process. Reporting incidents of sexual harassment is crucial for your own empowerment and for preventing such behavior from continuing.
